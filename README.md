### Introduction
Hi, I'm Akshay Kapoor. I am a Masters in Computer Science student at Drexel University. As someone with some previous software engineering experience, by taking SE577 I hope to expand my knowledge in this field and learn more about software architecture styles, modeling and analysis techniques, documentation, quality attributes, and how they apply in open-source, cloud-native, and industrial projects. Additionally, I'm excited to learn about modern web architectures, reactive architectures, and cloud-native architectures, and how they address the architectural needs of modern systems that require deployment flexibility, scalability, and design flexibility. Overall, I am looking forward to building my expertise in software architecture and applying what I learn in practical projects.
